My personal trajectory, however, took an intriguing turn, guiding me from the vast landscapes of the United States to the flat landscapes of the Netherlands. Along this uncharted course, I encountered more than just geographical transitions; I found myself navigating the intricate web of distinct regulations that intertwine with the process of thesis composition and the defense. Beyond the substantive content of my PhD thesis, a distinctive element caught my attention: the presence of propositions.</p> <p>At my university, you can formulate up to 10 propositions, of which only four may be related to the work you’ve produced during your PhD. The remaining propositions function as a sounding board, enabling you to reflect on the current state of your chosen field, spark interest in future research directions by introducing new challenges, and demonstrate your ability to engage in scholarly discussion outside your expertise.</p> <p>To commemorate my approaching defense, I am pleased to present here my first four propositions, all of which pertain to my research.</p> <p><strong>Proposition #1: Orchestrating Microstructure Control</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>“By tuning the shape and size of particles during evaporation inside a droplet, we are able to control the formation of self-assembled microstructures, enabling facile manipulation over the resultant materials structure.” – Chapter 2</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Proposition #2: The Guiding Hand of Magnetic Fields</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>“Employing magnetic fields is critical for directing the assembly of microparticles with long-range ordered structures during the drying process within a droplet.” – Chapter 3</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Proposition #3: Hematite’s Role as a Microswimmer</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>“Large scale production of active microswimmers is possible with hematite, offering a promising alternative to photocatalytic Janus particles often fabricated with several synthetic steps.” – Chapter 4</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Proposition #4: Challenging Polymerization Conventions</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>“One does not need to use the ‘gold-standard’ polymerization techniques to produce composite colloidal particles with distinctive properties.” – Chapter 5 &amp; 6</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="props"/><category term="Propositions"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflecting on four years]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflecting on the Dutch Soft Matter Meeting</title><link href="https://sschyck.github.io/blog/2023/DSMM/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflecting on the Dutch Soft Matter Meeting"/><published>2023-05-31T12:34:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-31T12:34:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sschyck.github.io/blog/2023/DSMM</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sschyck.github.io/blog/2023/DSMM/"><![CDATA[<figure style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"> <img src="/assets/img/smd_2019.jpg" alt="SMD 2019" style="width: 300px; border-radius: 8px;"/> <figcaption>2019 Dutch Soft Matter Meeting Soundbite</figcaption> </figure> <p>Recently, I had the incredible opportunity to present my research on anisotropic magnetic polystyrene at the Dutch Soft Matter Meeting at the University of Amsterdam. Happening twice a year, it serves as a gathering of like-minded individuals passionate about exploring the fascinating world of soft matter.</p> <p>I vividly remember my first year as a Ph.D. student, nervously stepping onto the stage to deliver a soundbite—a concise, two-minute pitch of my research. Back then, time felt constrained, and every word had to be carefully chosen to captivate the audience. But as I’ve grown in my academic journey, so too have my opportunities to share my work. Now, I find myself delivering full-fledged talks, confidently discussing the intricacies of my research.</p> <p>This particular meeting was filled with<a href="http://www.softmatter.nl/Meetings/33rd/"> remarkable speakers</a> , each sharing their unique insights. Heinrich Jaeger from the University of Chicago kicked off the day, enlightening us about trainable soft matter. <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/tnw/over-faculteit/afdelingen/chemical-engineering/principal-scientists/alina-rwei/rwei-group"> Alina Rwei</a> from my department here at TUDelft followed, captivating us with her talk on using soft matter for precision therapeutics including <a href="https://doi-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/10.1073/pnas.2019786117">wireless, biosensors that can be stuck to the skin of infants.</a> Corinna Maass from the University of Twente brought a fresh perspective with her discussion on <a href="http://asm.ds.mpg.de/index.php/self-propelling-droplets/">self propelling droplet swimmers,</a> while <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/micromechanics/giuntoli-group/">Andrea Giuntoli from RUG </a> explained that sometimes the wrong model can still help us design the right materials. The lineup continued with <a href="https://pbaconnier.fr/"> Paul Baconnier from AMOLF </a> and his exploration of active elastic solids, Farshid Jafarpour from Utrecht University and his insights into the statistical physics of bacterial growth, and <a href="https://comp-phys.univie.ac.at/dellago/"> Christoph Dellago from the University of Vienna </a> and his thoughts on machine learning for soft matter.</p> <p>The meeting venue buzzed with excitement and intellectual exchange, as researchers from different backgrounds came together to share their discoveries. I was thrilled to present my findings on anisotropic magnetic polystyrene, delving into the complexities of its preparation and deformation.</p> <p>As I concluded what would be my final talk as a Ph.D. student, a bittersweet mix of emotions washed over me. A sense of satisfaction and accomplishment tinged with a touch of melancholy filled the air. The discussions that followed were still rich with enthusiasm and curiosity, but there was an underlying awareness that this would be one of the last opportunities for fellow researchers to approach me as a PhD, eager to learn more about my work and share their own experiences.</p> <figure style="float: right; margin-right: 1em;"> <img src="/assets/img/smd_2023.jpg" alt="Soft Matter meeting Talk 2023" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 8px;"/> <figcaption>2023 Dutch Soft Matter Meeting Talk</figcaption> </figure> <p>The conference, once again, served as a poignant reminder of the power of scientific gatherings. It was a platform that fostered collaboration, creating an atmosphere where new connections were forged and boundaries of knowledge were pushed. Each interaction, each exchange of ideas, carried an added weight as I contemplated the culmination of my Ph.D. journey and the chapter that was coming to an end.</p> <p>As I bid farewell to the conference, my mind buzzed with a whirlwind of ideas, and my heart overflowed with gratitude. Gratitude for the opportunity to share my research, engage with fellow scientists, and be part of a vibrant community. These meetings, with their ability to ignite passion and fuel the drive for knowledge, will forever hold a special place in my heart. And though this may mark the end of one chapter, I eagerly anticipate the next gathering of brilliant minds in the soft-matter research community, where new beginnings and exciting possibilities await.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="talks"/><category term="talk,"/><category term="conference"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thoughts about the 33rd DSMM at the University of Amsterdam.]]></summary></entry></feed>
