I see you received my transmission, fellow cosmic voyagers! 🚀🌌

Join me at the Technical University of Delft on **September 6th**, where we'll embark on an exhilarating voyage into the microcosmos to explore the preparation and out-of-equilibrium assembly of magnetic and anisotropic particles. The current itinerary is as follows:

🌟 **Layman's Talk: 12:00 PM**

Prepare for an exhilarating journey through the essence of my research, translated for all sentient beings across the universe!

🌌 **PhD Defense: 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM**

Witness the cosmic clash of ideas and knowledge as I defend my thesis against the forces of doubt and skepticism. This is where the real scientific adventure unfolds!

🪐 **Short Reception: 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM**

After the intellectual journey, we'll refuel our minds and bodies with a brief reception. Share your thoughts, engage in celestial conversa tions, and enjoy some heavenly treats!

🌠 **Cosmic Celebration: 7:00 PM till the Stars Go Dim**

As the sun sets on one adventure, another begins. Gather at **the Gist** for an intergalactic party that will defy the boundaries of space and time! Don your favorite sci-fi attire, dance among the stars, and raise your glasses to a future filled with scientific marvels!

*Address:* [Phoenixstraat 4C, 2611 AL Delft](https://goo.gl/maps/hLDbt7YvbfpJNqr47)
