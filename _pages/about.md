Hello there! Thanks for stopping by!

I'm Sarah, a motivated PhD candidate with a background in utilizing wet chemistry techniques for the synthesis of colloidal materials. My academic journey has been dedicated to the exploration of various scientific techniques, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and more. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD in Chemical Engineering at TU Delft, Netherlands, focusing on the preparation and out-of-equilibrium assembly of anisotropic and magnetic microparticles.

When I'm not immersed in the world of research, I enjoy tennis, hiking, and board games. Whether it's a beach volleyball match, exploring new places, or spending quality time with friends and family, I find inspiration and balance outside the lab.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or learn more about my research. I'm always excited to engage with fellow researchers and explore new opportunities. Looking forward to connecting with you!
