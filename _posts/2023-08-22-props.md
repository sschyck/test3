Embarking on the journey of a PhD is an endeavor that often spans several challenging years, each step characterized by its own unique narrative. My personal trajectory, however, took an intriguing turn, guiding me from the vast landscapes of the United States to the flat landscapes of the Netherlands. Along this uncharted course, I encountered more than just geographical transitions; I found myself navigating the intricate web of distinct regulations that intertwine with the process of thesis composition and the defense. Beyond the substantive content of my PhD thesis, a distinctive element caught my attention: the presence of propositions. 

At my university, you can formulate up to 10 propositions, of which only four may be related to the work you've produced during your PhD. The remaining propositions function as a sounding board, enabling you to reflect on the current state of your chosen field, spark interest in future research directions by introducing new challenges, and demonstrate your ability to engage in scholarly discussion outside your expertise.

To commemorate my approaching defense, I am pleased to present here my first four propositions, all of which pertain to my research.


**Proposition #1: Orchestrating Microstructure Control**

> "By tuning the shape and size of particles during evaporation inside a droplet, we are able to control the formation of self-assembled microstructures, enabling facile manipulation over the resultant materials structure."
>  -- Chapter 2



**Proposition #2: The Guiding Hand of Magnetic Fields**

> "Employing magnetic fields is critical for directing the assembly of microparticles with long-range ordered structures during the drying process within a droplet."
> -- Chapter 3



**Proposition #3: Hematite's Role as a Microswimmer**

> "Large scale production of active microswimmers is possible with hematite, offering a promising alternative to photocatalytic Janus particles often fabricated with several synthetic steps."
> -- Chapter 4


**Proposition #4: Challenging Polymerization Conventions**

> "One does not need to use the 'gold-standard' polymerization techniques to produce composite colloidal particles with distinctive properties."
> -- Chapter 5 & 6
